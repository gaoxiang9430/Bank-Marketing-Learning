# Data-Mining Project 1
### Improved-RF
Currently, Improved-RF produce the best results. In this implementation, the mlr framework has been used. The algorithm has beed selected for training and testing is Random Forest.

### Combine
Several algorithms, including Bayes, RF, have been combined to generate final results. The results is not very promissing.
